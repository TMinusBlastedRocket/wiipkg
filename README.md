# wiipkg
an alternative to WAD based on 7z thats allows for installing multipule channels and/or IOS's at once and better compression for archival



# How to make a .wiipkg file
(We suggest using 7z for this)

Download the repo as a zip file 
extract the wiipkg folder (we will use this as a template)

until a wiipkg manager is made for wii, we will use existing WAD files for building a wiipkg
